5_Model_output

Output files from model calibration, hindcasting, and uncertainty partitioning

Guide to folders:

5.1_Calibration: output from script 4.2_Calibrate_Bayesian_models

There are three output files for each calibrated model:
[model name]_calibration.txt: runjags output for model calibration from 2009-2014
[model name]_param_summary.txt: summary of posterior parameter values and parameter convergence assessment metrics for each model calibration
[model name]_predicted_states.csv: the distribution of predicted G. echinulata density at each timestep during the calibration period

5.2_Hindcasting: output from script 4.3_Hindcasting

There are between 80-120 output files for each Bayesian state-space model, depending on how many sources of uncertainty can be partitioned given that model's structure. For example, a random walk model has only initial conditions, process, and observation error, while a dynamic linear model with one covariate additionally has parameter and driver error.
The names of the .csv files for each model follow the naming convention below:
[model name]_[sources of uncertainty included in hindcast]_[year of hindcast]_[week of year].csv
For example, the following file:
AR_det.prediction_2015_1.csv contains the 1-4 week hindcasts generated for weeks 1-4 of the 2015 sampling season for the AR model, with no forms of uncertainty included
A second example: 
GDD_hindcast.IC.Pa.D.P._2016_12.csv contains the 1-4 week hindcasts generated for weeks 12-15 of the 2016 sampling season for the GDD model, and includes initial conditions, parameter, driver, and process uncertainty

5.3_Uncertainty_partitioning: output from script 4.4_Uncertainty_partitioning

There are between 20-28 output files for each model, depending on the model structure. Hindcast output has been aggregated so that all one-week-ahead hindcasts are in the same file, all two-week-ahead hindcasts are in the same file, and so on.

Files with "vardat" in the file name contain the full distribution of hindcast output (so, 10000 rows of output for each week) and follow the naming convention below:
[model name]_[sources of uncertainty included in the hindcast]_[forecast horizon].csv
For example, the following file:
AR_vardat.det_1.csv contains the one-week-ahead hindcast output for all of 2015-2016 for the AR model with no sources of uncertainty included
A second example:
schmidt_and_wind_vardat.IC.Pa.D_3.csv contains the three-week-ahead hindcast output for all of 2015-2016 for the schmidt_and_wind model with initial conditions, parameter, and driver uncertainty included

Files with "varmat" in the file name contain a matrix with the variances generated by each hindcast type (IC, IC.Pa, IC.Pa.D, etc.) for all weeks in 2015-2016, allowing the viewer to see how hindcast variance increases as sources of uncertainty are sequentially added. These files follow the naming convention below:
[model name]_varmat_[forecast horizon].csv
Sources of uncertainty are always added in the following order: initial conditions, parameter, driver, process.
So, the variance of hindcasts with initial conditions uncertainty only will be in the first row of each varmat, the variance of hindcasts with initial conditions and parameter uncertainty will be in the second row, etc.
Note that not all models have all sources of uncertainty; for example, random-walk models do not have parameter uncertainty.

Files with "varRelative" in the file name contain a matrix with the relative contributions of each form of each type of hindcast (IC, IC.Pa, IC.Pa.D, etc) to total hindcast uncertainty. Files follow the same naming convention and structure as the varmat files.
