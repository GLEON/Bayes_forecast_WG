00_Data_files

Storage for data files associated with analysis that have been re-formatted from data publications housed at the Environmental Data Initiative (EDI)

Also storage for temporary "final" data files until they are published on EDI - the EDI data clones folder will (hopefully) be deleted prior to manuscript submission

Guide to file structure:

00A_Covariate_analysis_data: data that has been re-formatted from EDI data publications as input for 2_Covariate_correlation_analysis

00B_Bayesian_model_input_data: data that has been re-formatted from intermediary files (housed in 00A_Covariate_analysis_data) for input into Bayesian state-space models
