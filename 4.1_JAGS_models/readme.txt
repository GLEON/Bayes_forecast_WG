R files containing Bayesian models in JAGS format to run in rjags

Refer to Table 2 and Table S4 of the Lofton et al. 2021 manuscript for descriptions of model structure and covariates included in each model.

AC = null model with autocorrelation term; corresponds to AC model in manuscript

base_DLM = null dynamic linear model; correspond to BaseLM model in manuscript

GDD = GDD model in manuscript

precip = Precip model in manuscript

RW = random walk model with uninformed observation error prior; not presented in manuscript

RW_bias = random walk null model with bias term; correspond to OffsetRW in manuscript

RW_obs = random walk model with informed observation error prior; corresponds to RW model in manuscript

RY = random walk model with random year effect; not presented in manuscript due to inability to estimate non-zero year effect
