7_Model_ensemble

Exercise to see if ensemble of models performs better than individual models

The script 7_Model_ensemble runs through the following analysis steps for an unweighted model ensemble, or the aggregated output from all models:

4.4_Uncertainty_partitioning
6A_Predictive_intervals
6B_Hindcast_output_analysis
6C_Uncertainty partitioning output analysis

The resulting output files for model ensemble analysis are also housed in this folder.
