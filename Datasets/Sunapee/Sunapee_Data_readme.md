Read me file for Sunapee Data

RawData  = original Sunapee data shared for workshop with no edits beyond what Shannon did for the weekly summary she made
  
Level1 = modified Raw data to clean light and water temp HOBO data and gloeo data

All_Sites_Gloeo.csv
  * Most important change -> I removed duplicate samples from the same day and/or week from Shannon's weekly summary document for the gloeo observations and the new file is called All_Sites_Gloeo.csv. If you want to do anything with the gloeo data at each site, I would use this file from now on.
 
SummarizedData = Final summarized datasets to use in any analyses
