last modified 31Oct2017 by B. Steele, Weathers Lab, Cary Institute of Ecosystem Studies (steeleb@caryinstiute.org)

These files are for use in the GLEON Bayesian Modeling Workshop December 2017. The data are not for further distribution and shall not be used for any other purpose without first contacting Kathleen Weathers (weathersk@caryinstitute.org) and her colleagues.

This data is from Lake Sunapee, NH, USA from the time range 2005-2016. Lake Sunapee is a 16.69 square kilometer lake within a 123.44 square kilometer watershed (including the waterbody). The elevation of the lake 333.3m above sea level and has a maximum depth of 33.7m and a mean depth of 11.6m.

Data within this folder pertains to four sites in Lake Sunapee. The four sites are Coffin, Fichter, Midge and Newbury. For their relative locations in the lake, see the pdf file 'sampling_locations.pdf' in this folder.


folders:

--measured in-situ data: these are data from the monthly(ish) visits to two of the four sites (midge and newbury) included in the data set.

--temp and light sensor 2009-2016: these sensors are in the water from about early June to late September at each of the four sampling sites. The data is [mostly] in 10-minute intervals and reports water temperature (degrees C) and light (lux).

--temp sensors 2006-2016: these sensors are in the water from about early June to late September at each of the four sampling sites. They log temperature data (degrees C) hourly throughout the time they are deployed.

--weather: this file contains daily weather data 2005-2016 (min, max temp and precipitation, as well as documented high wind events)

--weekly gloeo: this folder contains the weekly gloeo counts for each of the 4 locations from 2005-2016.
